# About Randonneurs Ontario

Randonneurs Ontario is the provincial organization for long-distance cycling in Ontario, Canada. We are affiliated with Randonneurs Mondiaux, the international governing body for randonneuring.

## What is Randonneuring?

Randonneuring is long-distance cycling where riders follow a prescribed course and must complete it within a time limit. Unlike racing, randonneuring is non-competitive—riders aim to complete the course, not to beat others.

Events range from 200km brevets to 1200km grand randonnées, with the famous Paris-Brest-Paris (PBP) being the most prestigious event in the randonneuring calendar.

## Our Mission

We organize and support long-distance cycling events across Ontario, providing riders with:

- A calendar of brevets and permanents throughout the riding season
- Certified routes with cue sheets and GPS tracks
- Official results and recognition through Randonneurs Mondiaux
- A community of like-minded endurance cyclists

## Chapters

Randonneurs Ontario is organized into regional chapters:

- **Toronto** - Serving the Greater Toronto Area
- **Ottawa** - Serving Eastern Ontario
- **Huron** - Serving Southwestern Ontario
- **Simcoe** - Serving Central Ontario

Each chapter organizes its own events while following the rules and standards of Randonneurs Mondiaux.
