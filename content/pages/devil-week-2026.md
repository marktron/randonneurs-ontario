Devil Week challenges riders to complete a full Super Randonneur series in a single week. Hosted a rotating club chapter every year, it combines a long-distance personal challenge with the rare opportunity to ride, recover, and connect alongside fellow randonneurs day after day. Whether you're testing your limits or immersing yourself in the social side of ultra-distance cycling, Devil Week is as much about the community as the kilometers.

## 2026 Devil Week: Grimsby, ON

The 2026 edition of Devil Week is hosted by the Toronto chapter and will be run out of Grimsby. A block of hotel rooms at the starting location is being arranged – stay tuned for details.

### Monday June 15, 2026
- **Distance**: 600 km
- **Route**: [The Great Grimsby Gambit](./register/dw-the-great-grimsby-gambit-600km-2026-06-15)
- **Start time**: 05:00
- **Notes**: This is a new route for 2026, and takes us north to Orangeville and back on the first day. After an overnight stop back in Grimsby, day two offers a flatter spin around the Niagara peninsula.

### Thursday June 18, 2026
- **Distance**: 400 km
- **Route**: [Niagara Peninsula](./register/dw-niagara-peninsula-400km-2026-06-18)
- **Start time**: 06:00
- **Notes**: Also new for 2026, this route circumnavigates the borders of the Niagara region, and gives us the first of two Niagara Falls spottings for the week.

### Saturday June 20, 2026
- **Distance**: 300 km
- **Route**: [Lakes and Vines](./register/dw-lakes-and-vines-300km-2026-06-20)
- **Start time**: 07:00
- **Notes**: One of the Toronto chapter's most popular 300 km brevets, this edition has a modified start to leave from Grimsby instead of Oakville. Don't worry, it still has all the same Great Lakes (and great vines).

### Sunday June 21, 2026	
- **Distance**: 200 km
- **Route**: [Niagara Ramble](./register/dw-niagara-ramble-200km-2026-06-21)

- **Notes**: A classic route, and the perfect way to cap off your Devil Week experience.

### Sunday June 21, 2026	
- **Distance**: 100 km
- **Route**: [Niagara Rambulaire](./register/dw-niagara-rambulaire-100km-2026-06-21)
