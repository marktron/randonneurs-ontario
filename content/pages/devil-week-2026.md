Devil Week is a one-week endurance cycling challenge designed to let riders complete a full Super Randonneur series in a single week. Hosted as a shared base event, it combines long-distance personal challenge with the rare opportunity to ride, recover, and connect alongside fellow randonneurs day after day. Whether you’re testing your limits or immersing yourself in the social side of ultra-distance cycling, Devil Week is as much about community as it is about the kilometers.

## 2026 Devil Week: Grimsby, ON

The 2026 edition of Devil Week is hosted by the Toronto chapter and will be run out of Grimsby. A block of hotel rooms is being arranged, more details to come.

### Monday June 15, 2026
- **Distance**: 600 km
- **Route**: [The Great Grimsby Gambit](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/53043779)
- **Start time**: 05:00
- **Notes**: This is a new route for 2026, and takes us north to Orangeville and back on the first day. After an overnight stop back in Grimsby, day two offers a flatter spin around the Niagara peninsula.
